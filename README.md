# Meet-Halfway-App
Make School Demo App

My app, MeetHalfway, is a location-based meet up app which finds a reasonable midpoint location between two people so that they could grab a meal, watch a sports game, or just hang out in an ideal location not too far from either of them. MeetHalfway makes meeting up much more efficient and easy since all the information you need will be accessible within one app. Usually, people have had to check yelp, maps, google, or multiple other platforms to figure out where to meet. But, with MeetHalfway, all these factors will be taken into account for those who want a quick and easy way to meet up with friends. MeetHalfway finds you a place to meet to grab a bite to eat.
